Welcomes to Crossy Road! In this game 
we need to use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right)
to move the duck across the road without getting
hit by the cars. There are 5 different levels. To complete a level 
you must successfully cross the road to the green flag and back 
to the white flag. If you complete all 5 levels you win!
Good luck!
